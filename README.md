##Codelab: iOS Application Development with Swift

Apple released Swift to public in 2014 and made it open source a year later. Nowadays, Swift is one of the most popular open source project on GitHub and developers utilize Swift to develop iOS, MacOS, WatchOS and tvOS applications on Mac and Web applications on Linux. Swift has a modern syntax that makes programming fun and applications fast and robust. Swift combines object-oriented programming with functional programming and protocol oriented programming paradigms. Since Swift is so new and still developing, there are not a lot of expert Swift developers in the field yet. Learning Swift in these early stages can help to get ahead of competition, therefore, this codelab aims to be an accelerator for getting started with Swift programming and iOS application development. Codelab will start by introducing Swift related programming language paradigms and will continue by developing a simple iOS application that provides some of the essentinal mobile application capabilities such as dependency management, back-end web service integration, JSON parsing and mapping, on device data storage, navigation, listing received items and presenting views to the users.
